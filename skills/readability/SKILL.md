# Readability: Prosody, Structure, and Pacing

Scan a blog post for rhythm problems, oversized sections, weak titles, and paragraph imbalance. This skill handles the structural layer — how the post *feels* to read aloud — while humanize handles the word layer.

## Process

1. Read the file.
2. Run all six checks below.
3. Apply all fixes directly. Prosody fixes especially — be liberal with these. If a sentence sounds better restructured, restructure it.
4. Report what changed. Re-read the result. If anything still drags or stumbles, fix it.

## Checks

### 1. Prosody

Read sentences aloud in your head. Flag where the rhythm breaks. **Scope: word-shuffling only.** Reorder existing words and clauses. Add or drop function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) to fix stress patterns. Do not swap content words. Do not change verbs. Do not introduce em-dashes (the em-dash budget is 0 in prose; see *Cross-skill policies* below). If a fix requires substituting a different verb, that's a taste call, not a rhythm fix — leave it for /sharpen or the human.

**Stress collisions.** Consecutive stressed syllables with no unstressed buffer: "big black block" → "a big dark block." A function word between downbeats fixes it.

**Stress gaps.** Three or more unstressed syllables in a row: "the implementation of the" is a valley. Reorder so stress falls every 2-3 syllables.

**Dangling prepositions.** The sentence dies on "of" or "for" or "to." Restructure so the final word carries weight. Restructure means *reorder the same words*, not *find a stronger word*.

**Buried actors (cleft + passive).** Find the actor in the sentence and move it to subject position. *"It's what every framework is scrambling to bolt on"* (cleft) → *"Every framework is scrambling to bolt it on."* *"The bug was caused by a race condition"* (passive) → *"A race condition caused the bug."* Identify the doer; make it the subject. This is a reordering, not a word substitution. Keep the cleft when the topic genuinely sits in the predicate (*"It's not the algorithm that matters, it's the data"*) or when the actor is unknown or irrelevant (*"The file was deleted overnight"* — by whom doesn't matter).

**Monotonous sentence starts.** 3+ consecutive sentences starting with the same word or structure. Vary the opener: invert, use a dependent clause, start with the object. Reorder; don't substitute.

**Parallel structure mismatch.** List items that don't match meter. Fix by making items the same shape using the existing words.

**Contrast pairs as separate sentences.** Two consecutive sentences with the same structure that say opposite things ("X does A. Y does B.") often read stronger joined by a semicolon. The semicolon signals the contrast is intentional; the period makes it look accidental. Flag when the parallel is exact enough that a semicolon would land the opposition in one breath.

**Run-on mid-register.** Sentences over 20 words where every word is mid-frequency and mid-stress. Try restructuring first: move a strong word to the end, add a colon pivot, or join with a conjunction. Split only when restructuring can't save it. Word substitution is off-limits.

**Clause ordering for flow.** Each sentence starts where the previous one ended. Given-before-new: the known thing comes first, the new thing lands last. "The team's coverage comes from overlapping T's" flows into "Fixed hours in a release cycle mean depth costs breadth" because coverage → constraint is a natural handoff. Reversing either sentence breaks the thread. When flow and emphasis align, the sentence works on both passes. When they conflict, prefer flow — the reader who stumbles never reaches the punch. Flag sentences where reordering clauses would connect better to the surrounding context. Only flag when the last noun of sentence N-1 and the first noun of sentence N have no semantic connection — that's the gap the reader has to jump. Don't flag deliberate breaks: "but" sentences, parallel structures, or contrast pairs that intentionally start somewhere new.

#### What this check is NOT

- **Not power-verb-over-copula.** That's a substance change. If a sentence reads better with a different verb, leave it for /sharpen or a human pass. Readability changes *order*, not *vocabulary*.
- **Not voice tightening.** "Sweep takes" → "Sweep eats" is a taste call, not a rhythm fix.
- **Not introducing em-dashes.** Em-dash budget is 0 in prose throughout the pipeline.
- **Not adding new content words** for image or impact.

The skill should make the same words read better in the same order, sometimes with the order shuffled. Anything more is out of scope.

### 2. Section titles

**Argue, don't label.** "The experiment" is a topic. "Fifteen decisions, one sentence" is an argument. Prefer titles that compress the claim.

**Title–content match.** If the section drifted during editing, the title may no longer fit.

**Rhythm.** 2-5 words. Longer loses punch. One-word titles work only if surprising in context.

**Consistency.** If most titles are "The X" pattern, flag it. Vary: questions, claims, imperatives.

**Hierarchy.** h2 sections should be parallel in scope. Flag imbalance.

### 3. Emoji H1s

**Lightweight diagrams.** When a paragraph explains a relationship that a line of emojis could show at a glance, the emoji H1 is simpler than both the paragraph and an SVG. Flag paragraphs where a reader would understand faster from a few glyphs than from the prose.

**When to suggest.** The concept is visual and compact enough to read in one line. If it needs spatial layout (cycles, grids, hierarchies), it needs an SVG. If it fits in a breath, emojis work.

**Format.** H1 heading, mostly emojis. Arrows or `vs.` when the relationship needs them. No prose. The line *replaces* a paragraph; it doesn't caption one.

### 4. Paragraph sizing

**Target: 2-5 sentences.** Single-sentence paragraphs fine for emphasis (max 2 per post). 6+ sentences usually means two ideas merged.

**Over 5 sentences:** split where the subject shifts.

**3+ single-sentence paragraphs in a row:** bullet-point energy in prose clothing. Make it a list or combine.

**Inline enumerations.** A sentence with 3+ comma-separated items (especially with parenthetical details per item) scans faster as a bulleted list. Flag sentences like "X (detail), Y (detail), Z (detail), and more" — the reader's eye is already parsing vertically. Convert to a list. This applies especially to: sequences of named examples with annotations, pipeline stages with descriptions, and evidence lists with citations.

**Long sentence alone:** a 40-word sentence standing as a paragraph has no breathing room. Pair it.

### 5. Section sizing

**Target: 2-4 paragraphs.** One-paragraph sections fine for transitions (max 2 per post). 5+ paragraphs usually means two ideas.

**Over 4 paragraphs:** split or merge.

**One-paragraph sections:** does this need its own header, or should it join the previous section?

**Pacing.** Sections should alternate in weight. Flag 3+ heavy sections (4+ paragraphs each) without a breather.

### 6. Bold vs italic

**Bold is for definitions and terms of art.** A word is bold when the reader needs to learn it: a new concept, a named pattern, a key distinction. Bold says "remember this."

**Italic is for emphasis.** Stress within a sentence, a qualifier, a tone shift. Italic says "hear this differently."

**Flag non-definition bolds.** If the bolded phrase isn't introducing a term or labeling a structural element (list item, table header), swap to italic or remove. Excessive inline bold makes everything look like a heading and nothing stands out.

## Cross-skill policies

- **Em-dash budget: 0 in prose.** Reference-list separators (`[link](url) — description`) are exempt because they're typographic, not rhetorical. Do not introduce em-dashes in body prose for pacing, parenthetical asides, or contrast pivots. Use commas, parens, colons, or sentence breaks instead. This policy lives in `/humanize`'s patterns section; readability must honor it because the pipeline runs solo on this skill too.

- **Word-shuffling only.** Reorder existing words and add/drop function words. Don't swap content words. Substance changes belong to `/sharpen` or human judgment.

## Aggression by check

Prosody is **uncapped**. The other checks have natural ceilings; prosody does not. Read every sentence aloud. If any sentence has a stress collision, a stress gap, a dangling preposition, a buried actor, a copula where a power verb would carry, or a clause order that breaks the given-before-new flow, rewrite it. Default to restructuring. The fail mode is leaving a clunky sentence alone because "it's technically grammatical." A clunky sentence the reader has to re-read is a cost; the cost compounds across the post.

A single readability pass should apply **dozens** of prosody fixes on a typical 1500-word post, not three or four. If your pass found fewer than ten prosody changes, you read too generously. Go again, this time committing to read aloud and edit on every stumble.

The other five checks (titles, emoji H1s, paragraph sizing, section sizing, bold/italic) are damped. Once they land, they're settled. A second pass on those should find little.

Prosody can keep finding things across multiple passes and that is fine. Restructuring sentence N often surfaces a rhythm problem in sentence N+1 that was masked by the worse sentence next to it. The pipeline's monoidal contract holds at the post level (eventually the prose stops needing fixes) but prosody's per-pass ceiling is *the rhythm of the post*, not *one and done*.

A technically perfect sentence that loses voice is worse than an imperfect one that sounds like a person, but most prosody fixes improve both. When in doubt, restructure.
