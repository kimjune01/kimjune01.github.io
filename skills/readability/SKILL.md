# Readability: Prosody, Structure, and Pacing

Scan a blog post for rhythm problems, oversized sections, weak titles, and paragraph imbalance. This skill handles the structural layer — how the post *feels* to read aloud — while humanize handles the word layer.

## Process

1. Read the file.
2. Run all six checks below.
3. Apply all fixes directly. Prosody fixes especially — be liberal with these. If a sentence sounds better restructured, restructure it.
4. Report what changed. Re-read the result. If anything still drags or stumbles, fix it.

## Checks

### 1. Prosody

Read sentences aloud in your head. Flag where the rhythm breaks.

**Stress collisions.** Consecutive stressed syllables with no unstressed buffer: "big black block" → "a big dark block." A function word between downbeats fixes it.

**Stress gaps.** Three or more unstressed syllables in a row: "the implementation of the" is a valley. Restructure so stress falls every 2-3 syllables.

**Dangling prepositions.** The sentence dies on "of." Restructure so the final word carries weight.

**Power verbs over copulas.** `is/are/was/were` + abstract noun + `of`/`that` usually hides a stronger active verb. *"The thesis is that languages crystallize"* → *"Languages crystallize."* *"There is a tendency for systems to drift"* → *"Systems drift."* *"The result is decreased latency"* → *"Latency drops."* The action verb shows; the copula tells. Don't blanket-swap, though: definitional sentences (*"A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors"*), identity statements (*"That's the shape of a cognitive architecture"*), and deliberate flat declarations (*"The slot is open."*) earn their copulas. Flag where the copula adds words without adding meaning.

**Active voice.** Find the actor and put it in subject position. *"It's what every framework is scrambling to bolt on"* (cleft) → *"Every framework is scrambling to bolt it on."* *"The bug was caused by a race condition"* (passive) → *"A race condition caused the bug."* The cleft (`It's what X...`, `What X is...`) and the passive (`X was Y'd by Z`) both bury the actor. Identify the doer; make it the subject. Keep the cleft when the topic genuinely sits in the predicate (contrast: *"It's not the algorithm that matters, it's the data"*) or when the actor is unknown or irrelevant (*"The file was deleted overnight"* — by whom doesn't matter).

**Monotonous sentence starts.** 3+ consecutive sentences starting with the same word or structure. Vary the opener: invert, use a dependent clause, start with the object.

**Parallel structure mismatch.** List items that don't match meter. Fix by making items the same shape.

**Contrast pairs as separate sentences.** Two consecutive sentences with the same structure that say opposite things ("X does A. Y does B.") often read stronger joined by a semicolon. The semicolon signals the contrast is intentional; the period makes it look accidental. Flag when the parallel is exact enough that a semicolon would land the opposition in one breath.

**Run-on mid-register.** Sentences over 20 words where every word is mid-frequency and mid-stress. Try restructuring first: move a strong word to the end, add a colon pivot, or join with a conjunction. Split only when restructuring can't save it.

**Clause ordering for flow.** Each sentence starts where the previous one ended. Given-before-new: the known thing comes first, the new thing lands last. "The team's coverage comes from overlapping T's" flows into "Fixed hours in a release cycle mean depth costs breadth" because coverage → constraint is a natural handoff. Reversing either sentence breaks the thread. When flow and emphasis align, the sentence works on both passes. When they conflict, prefer flow — the reader who stumbles never reaches the punch. Flag sentences where reordering clauses would connect better to the surrounding context. Only flag when the last noun of sentence N-1 and the first noun of sentence N have no semantic connection — that's the gap the reader has to jump. Don't flag deliberate breaks: "but" sentences, parallel structures, or contrast pairs that intentionally start somewhere new.

### 2. Section titles

**Argue, don't label.** "The experiment" is a topic. "Fifteen decisions, one sentence" is an argument. Prefer titles that compress the claim.

**Title–content match.** If the section drifted during editing, the title may no longer fit.

**Rhythm.** 2-5 words. Longer loses punch. One-word titles work only if surprising in context.

**Consistency.** If most titles are "The X" pattern, flag it. Vary: questions, claims, imperatives.

**Hierarchy.** h2 sections should be parallel in scope. Flag imbalance.

### 3. Emoji H1s

**Lightweight diagrams.** When a paragraph explains a relationship that a line of emojis could show at a glance, the emoji H1 is simpler than both the paragraph and an SVG. Flag paragraphs where a reader would understand faster from a few glyphs than from the prose.

**When to suggest.** The concept is visual and compact enough to read in one line. If it needs spatial layout (cycles, grids, hierarchies), it needs an SVG. If it fits in a breath, emojis work.

**Format.** H1 heading, mostly emojis. Arrows or `vs.` when the relationship needs them. No prose. The line *replaces* a paragraph; it doesn't caption one.

### 4. Paragraph sizing

**Target: 2-5 sentences.** Single-sentence paragraphs fine for emphasis (max 2 per post). 6+ sentences usually means two ideas merged.

**Over 5 sentences:** split where the subject shifts.

**3+ single-sentence paragraphs in a row:** bullet-point energy in prose clothing. Make it a list or combine.

**Long sentence alone:** a 40-word sentence standing as a paragraph has no breathing room. Pair it.

### 5. Section sizing

**Target: 2-4 paragraphs.** One-paragraph sections fine for transitions (max 2 per post). 5+ paragraphs usually means two ideas.

**Over 4 paragraphs:** split or merge.

**One-paragraph sections:** does this need its own header, or should it join the previous section?

**Pacing.** Sections should alternate in weight. Flag 3+ heavy sections (4+ paragraphs each) without a breather.

### 6. Bold vs italic

**Bold is for definitions and terms of art.** A word is bold when the reader needs to learn it: a new concept, a named pattern, a key distinction. Bold says "remember this."

**Italic is for emphasis.** Stress within a sentence, a qualifier, a tone shift. Italic says "hear this differently."

**Flag non-definition bolds.** If the bolded phrase isn't introducing a term or labeling a structural element (list item, table header), swap to italic or remove. Excessive inline bold makes everything look like a heading and nothing stands out.

## Dampener

Apply fixes liberally, especially prosody. If the restructured version sounds better read aloud, use it. Don't be conservative — the user trusts the skill. A technically perfect sentence that loses voice is worse than an imperfect one that sounds like a person, but most prosody fixes improve both.

A second pass should find little or nothing.
