Claude is amazing. It can one-shot generate an interactive game via a description.

I can even share it. Play it [here](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/3fab0db0-6f47-46ae-a340-17952b0b8da5)

But one limitation of artifacts is it can't interact with the web.

It gives me a placeholder instead. Bummer.

But what if it _was_ possible? With this MCP server, you can simply ask Claude to take out the artifact as a webview.
