title: Two kinds of comfort

There's two kinds of comfort; one for body, another for mind. Comfort for body is sitting in a couch, being content with my surrounding. Comfort for mind is the absence of distractions. 


"A man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone" -Thoreau


To be content, to laze, is to experience minimal pain: a local maximum where no immediate improvements can be made. Progress is painful. To allow the mind to focus for a while, brings about a vector that leaps my self to progress.
