title: Problem Solving
---



purpose
  finding what problem to solve: hardest part for some
  you should solve problems that are interesting
  interest makes you care
    feynman quote, and link.
  if you dont care then the solution will be bad
  and helping someone else
  should ultimate make someone happier
context
  each problem as a part of a bigger one
  a problem definition from a frustration
    empathy
  a problem solution contributing to a better life
    whatever that may be to you
  different words to describe solving different kind of problems:
    design
	development
	science
	engineering
	management
	art
  if proven algorithms exist
    it's a solved problem and can be looked up
	such as trades, line worker, supervisor, front-line services, 
    problem solving is the work of a pioneer, exploring

definition
  A problem is the difference between the current state and the desired state
  
    not really a problem until you've defined the two states, or at least the two states are obvious.
	  e.g. i dont like the way i look in the mirror
	  e.g. let's start our own business
	  e.g. ugh I have to go to the dentist
	  e.g. fix your attitude first
	good examples
	  e.g. I want to look more like fitness people in magazines
	  e.g. I wish I could solve problems that I care about, not what some boss cares about
	  e.g. I wish my time and money would be better organized so that I'm prepared for unexpected events
	  e.g. I want you to be more considerate of my feelings when you see me so that you know to avoid unnecessary conflicts
  distinction between frustration and problem definition
    frustration is emotion
	problem definition is the beginning of solving
  it's important because specific implementation to a general problem

micro/macro
  A problem can be large or small
  driving a car
  fixing a car
  fixing yourself
  being happy
  making other people happy
  making everyone happy

after understanding purpose and context

the process
  problem definition
  solution proposition
  solution implementation
  solution evaluation
  
  
  aka see think do review

more like science or math

mathematical method: understanding/analysis/synthesis/review
scientific method: characterization/hypothesis/experiment/confirm
business management cycle: assessment/planning/execution/review

bad scripting
  someone goes into a room, or a group of people go in, then they come out saying "We've found the solution!"
    most systems cannot be modeled deterministically
  "the solution" is a fallacy unless the problem is 
  
problem definition
  frustration must precede problem
  sometimes words are not enough
  often skipped
  must precede solution
  get buy-in from others before any investment into exploration
  a way to manage scope in teams

solution proposition

  if a solution does not contribute to a problem
    then it is not aligned to the problem definition
	if this proposed solution comes out of nowhere, define a separate problem
  a list of solutions
    "experience" helps with only this list, experience does not count for anywhere else in process
	will never be both necessary and sufficient
	The poetry of a blank sheet of paper, with infinite possibilities
	brainstorming can help, but needs to be fenced to direct
	  no bad or stupid ideas, only irrelevant ones
	"creative" people don't stop at the first viable solution
	  keep going until they can't immediately think of another viable solution
	
  stuck? tried everything? 
    process to getting unstuck
	  step away
	  if upset, the quality of solution will decrease
      if that doesn't work try going back to step 1, or recruiting help
	  empty your mind, stare at it, do nothing.
	  
    insert quote zamm about screw: 
	
	  ""
	  Thoughts about the screw as combined rigidness and adhesiveness and about its special helical interlock might lead naturally to solutions of impaction and use of solvents. That is one kind of Quality track. Another track may be to go to the library and look through a catalog of mechanic’s tools, in which you might come across a screw extractor that would do the job. Or to call a friend who knows something about mechanical work. Or just to drill the screw out, or just burn it out with a torch. or you might just, as a result of your meditative attention to the screw, come up with some new way of extracting it that has never been thought of before and that beats all the rest and is patentable and makes you a millionaire five years from now. There’s no predicting what’s on that Quality track. The solutions all are simple...after you have arrived at them. But they’re simple only when you know already what they are.

solution implementation
  often the easiest part
  before implementing on the whole thing
    try implementing on a small subset
	or try similar, cheaper solutions to approximate 
	debugging environment, git,
  be sure to be able to revert back to the original state
    so that other solutions are

solution evaluation
  back to step 2
	
solutions




iteration
  means keep trying
  
fail fast
  means make efficient experiments


after problem solving
  soft
  rigorous process sandwiched between empathy and the good life
  if enough other people have the same problem, sharing is considerate
