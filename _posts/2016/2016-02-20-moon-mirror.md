The moon is a mirror in ways more than one
It reflects the sun's rays from a hundred million miles away,
Passing on its greetings.

It's a mirror in another way.
When you open your eyes gaping wide to the full blue moon, 
You see a halo of your iris, refracted onto your retina;
You are seeing yourself.

It's also a mirror in a more special way.
When you see the moon and you know that I'm seeing it at the same time â€”
No matter how distant we are, 
We are seeing each other in the moon.
