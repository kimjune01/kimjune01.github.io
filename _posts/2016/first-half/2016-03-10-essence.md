The essence of fire is that it must keep burning

The essence of water is that it flows

The essence of trees is that it branches

The essence of poetry is its desire to be spoken

The essence of programming is specifying

The essence of science is knowing

The essence of conflict is misunderstanding


The essence of something is what makes it it and not something else.
