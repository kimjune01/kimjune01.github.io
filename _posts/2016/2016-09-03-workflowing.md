First of all, local tunnel is nice!

Second of all, making calls to local tunnel is so fast!

Thirdly, it's very very quick to respond

In fact, it responds every two seconds or so after hitting the save button

This is not using tmux or vim, I'm simply using sublime.

Hitting the save button every few seconds allows anyone from anywhere to be able to respond to my changes in human time
