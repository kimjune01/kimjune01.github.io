As I'm sitting in the middle of the bus, I am looking back towards the rear of the bus where you are staring out the window on this gorgeous late-summer day. Your pure skin is radiating with the gleams of reflection off the cars and windows outside on this long bus ride. And I'm noticing you noticing the many things outside the window. You are such a curious person. Whatever it is that you are listening to with your earbuds, I don't know. But if I were to imagine, it would be as if you're watching a movie; of the flow of life on the streets passing by you. 

Too bad that this movie cannot show how beautiful you are, staring out the window.
