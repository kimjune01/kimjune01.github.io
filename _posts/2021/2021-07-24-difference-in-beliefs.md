On the previous day, a teacher and a student had a disagreement about quality, but the conversation ended with an abrupt gentleness. The student said, "Let's just do what is good." Those words were opaque to the teacher. Frustrated, the teacher came up with a plan to teach this lesson, to end the misunderstanding once and for all. Only if the student understood what quality meant, the world will be better. It's obvious that the teacher knows what the student does not. 

So as the teacher tried to explain the nature of quality, he was interrupted. The student began explaining to the teacher, what was about to be explained to him. The teacher could not have said it any better.

It was at that moment that the teacher was enlightened.
