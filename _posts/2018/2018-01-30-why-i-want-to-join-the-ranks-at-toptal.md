title: Why I want to join the ranks at Toptal

### Toptal? I should've joined earlier

I've been a freelance developer for about two years. I can bring app ideas to life, or refactor a legacy application into a lean environment where other developers can thrive. I know I have the skills, but proving that I had it meant solving stupid junior-level coding questions. Some companies would challenge me to an algorithms question even when I applied as an iOS developer. 

Then I was introduced to [Toptal](toptal.com). On both sides of the market, I saw my client hire a designer from them, and a designer friend charging SF dollars in Vancouver working remotely. I wanted in.

The biggest appeal was obviously not needing to prove myself every time. Prove it once, and get it over with. It was like having a referral network to give me credibility. I hated being treated like a juniot developer. One time, a recruiter counted the number of months of iOS development I had to assess my 'skills'.

I am in the process of getting in. Wish me luck!
