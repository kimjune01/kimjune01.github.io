Receiving beauty is the expansion of the self outwards to time and being

Each moment in beauty perception in the mind's eye awakes you to embrace —

The newly found increment of the universe; then,

This universe in which you belong to begins to belong to you

Each slice of the past now allows you to pull into you, a fragment of the future

Touching the essence of each new encounter, absorbed into your being

This encloses the relation between you and the whole

And where you go becomes who you are

You were, are, will — being — you, me, all.
