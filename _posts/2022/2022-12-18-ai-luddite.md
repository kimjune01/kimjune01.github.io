Luddite

same thing but with stealing what's not theirs, and less about clothes, it can be compared, but it's not the same if you look at the details...

kimjune01
just as words make up poems, brushstrokes make up paintings. Copying words to make a new composition is an original work. Copying brushstrokes to make a new painting is an original work. Sampling is a valid form of original art, and so is mashing up paintings. Artists didnâ€™t complain when other humans mashed paintings, but only so when the cost is reduced to a few keystrokes. Just as sewing machines do their work, new machines do theirs. Does not invalidate the old way of making, but elevates it via augmentation.

sirgusart
look, I see your point, but when a company uses other people's work without their consent to teach a machine how to paint like them, copying them, just to make profit, then where's the limit here, I know AI can be a tool for us, but when it's made with the foundation of stealing, then we are doing something wrong, the sewing machine still needs people for them to be used, and needs practice and hard work to master it, it's a tool to make easy the job, this apps not only make the work easy, they do all the work , people just want the inmediate job of the AI and the low price, while this machine has no soul, nor have learned from artists, it's directly fed with artist's hard work, I know you're trying to be positive about this situation, but the problem here is our job being vulnerable cuz someone decided our work was too expensive and they would do the same, using that hard work without permission and make profit ðŸ˜‚ hope you understand

programmers and engineers have been trying to end jobs for centuries, I understand. But if a robot can do your job, maybe itâ€™s time to learn something else. It used to be somebodyâ€™s job to operate an elevator, and not long until Uber drivers get displaced. The clock donâ€™t turn backwards on this. You canâ€™t stop robots from looking at art. No government can send me to jail because they canâ€™t tell the difference between robot art and human art.

see? That's the thing, I won't quit and do something else just cause somebody stole our hard work and decided to be ok with it, this is my Passion, my life, my feelings poured into what I love since I could barely write a word, if you choose to be ok with this, fine, hope this doesn't come in the future to bite your ass, but know something, if it does, I'll be there to support whoever is feeling what we're feeling right now, cuz this is no more humans against AI, this is humans against greedy humans, have a good day sir...

kimjune01
how much more art would you be able produce with the help of robots? You can train it with your work and multiply your output

sirgusart
you must be out of your mind to think I think like that, I don't think on how many pieces I can produce, I think on how Happy i can maje someone with my work, how amazed and in awe with the love and dedication I put into every stroke, I don't think on mass production, I'm not an AI, I'm an artist, a Human being, not a machine...

kimjune01
I appreciate the thought and dedication as you do, it is the basis of human connection, to care. Yet I donâ€™t care if my hoodie was sewn by man or machine, or if my books were written by hand or press. There will always be room for human art, but I wouldnâ€™t care if corporate marketersâ€™ Christmas cards were drawn or generated. Art will become craft, as IKEA displaced woodworking. I love woodworking.

kimjune01
thank you for the wholehearted responses. Itâ€™s refreshing to interact with humans than with automatons at work.

sirgusart
just my inner thoughts, this is really my Passion, and if you need to have a deep conversation about this or any other issue, I'm up for it, I mean it, always being polite of course ðŸ˜‚

sirgusart
Hahahahahahaha your really think the people that's using this can do really small details corrections?? Wow you must be really joking, that's doesn't even look like ghibli btw, Ghibli does all their thing using gouache, this my friend, has no soul, has no depth, has nothing to do with a piece that can bring some sort of joy or feelings, it's so flat you can even see the stable diffusion at work on the edges, oh, and wait till Photoshop uses this, they'll loose a lot of costumers if this even gets done ðŸ˜‚

kimjune01
Will it ever be possible that you wouldnâ€™t be able to distinguish the difference between human art and machine art?

sirgusart
I hope not, hope to be dead by then, cuz that's when we would've lost our humanity, and I don't want to be part of that world, I'm already disenchanted as it is. Now, would it ever be possible for you to see that what we do is what we love and this is just killing a beautiful proffesion?

kimjune01
There will always be demand for artists, but not for doing work that robots can

sirgusart
Do you have a job? A hobby? Something that you love doing?

kimjune01
I work and I love making things that improve my life
I used to do creative work but I moved onto a higher paying career in software
Iâ€™m not opposed to your sentiment but I wanted to share my perspective

sirgusart
But you didn't answer my question, lemme refrase it, what you love doing, what makes u smile even if you don't gain any money from it...

kimjune01
I like making stuff and making short videos
I also enjoy playing with my kids
I also enjoy writing from time to time

sirgusart
Those lil things, that make u whole, that's how I feel about art, that would never be replaced by an AI, and it would be something you could see in every piece I make, not on an AI piece

kimjune01
No ai is stopping you from doing what you love
And no robot will stop me either

sirgusart
That's were I wanted to for you to see

kimjune01
We can keep doing what we love, and some algorithm isnâ€™t taking anything away from that
