### The Todo-bot
- Does what you tell it to do, compliant with any request
- Takes a list and does them in order
- Tells you when it's doing somthing or when it's stuck
- Maintain itself, when told to do so
- Respects your authority at all times
- Comes with a built-in progress bar
- Needs rewards for each task done

### The Auto-bot
- Does not always do what's told
- Needs description on how the world will change by its actions
- Can only focus on one goal at a time; can't process goal lists
- Achieves the goal autonomously by seeking tasks towards it
- Can't tell you exactly what it will do, or when it will do it
- Maintains itself so that it can achieve the goal
- When multiple tasks are available, it chooses ones that achieve the goal
- Always tries to achieve the goal, but there's no progress bar
- Needs rewards for doing the right thing
