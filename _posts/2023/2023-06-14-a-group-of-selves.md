Previously, I presented the idea of model of self in [Empirical Method for Self Nurture](/empirical-method-for-self-nurture). It described an objective way to observe ourselves.

But it's a black box. What's inside? For a model to be useful, it needs to be able to predict a result given the inputs. When I reflect on my past and think about why I did what I did, I tell a story of what happened, and possibly an internal dialogue. For small decisions, it feels like having a small conversation between two people. For big decisions, it feels like I'm in a meeting. But who are these people inside me? Where did they come from? What do they want?
