A product organization exists to allow workers like myself to achieve big things that we cannot as individuals. We rally around a vision to work together. As we build the product, we face an combinatorially large number of ways to turn the vision into smaller increments([See Granularity Gradient](http://scrumbook.org.datasenter.no/value-stream/product-backlog/granularity-gradient.html)). But to realize the vision, we need to choose a sequence of goals and actions. We call this planning. Intuitively, goals become actionable as they divide into tasks that each individual can handle. Naively, we put those tasks on a list and ask others to get it done. We call this Project Management.

But what is it about checking off tasks from a list that makes us feel like cogs in a machine? More precisely, why doesn't it jive with our neurochemistry? Where is the meaning in checkboxes? What's the point in doing more than the bare minimum? I don't find motivation in getting paid a bit more or not getting fired. I find meaning in the big picture, but I don't enjoy doing things just so I can move a ticket to the 'Done' column. Is there a way to make work fun and intrinsically rewarding?

_When a goal is assigned as tasks, it loses its relation to the shared vision; but hooking into our dopamine system requires visualizing the outcomes our effort ([learn more with Andrew Huberman](https://youtu.be/K-TW2Chpz4k?t=1889)). Therefore, transmit the goals in the vision context to developers who expend the effort._

_Would you rather receive a TODO memo in JIRA or be shown the goal for a critical mission?_
