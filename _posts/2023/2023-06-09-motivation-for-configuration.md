_My life often feel repetitive, mundane, and even futile..._

_spending most of my time maintaining financial, social, physical, and mental status..._

_while I work in a dark room with terrible posture in exchange for money..._

_that I spend for obligatory expenses._

_What little attention I have left is bombarded with stimuli from all directions..._

_leaving no room for the people I encounter in real life, becoming apathetic to their otherwise genuine presence..._

_And when I finally put down the phone to sleep, I reflect on the decision to have eaten that cookie._

### Dissonance

If you were to ask what I value, what I really care about â€” I would say reflecting/growing activities with people I love, and doing whatever it takes to sustain them. But if you were to look at what I actually do, my life is filled with meaningless activities, often with people I don't care about. What I do isn't what I truly want. 

But to sustain my existance, I am compelled to work for money, pay for rent, and afford the required expenses to sustain a life away from home. Stress accumulates as to require vacations so that I can get back on the 9-to-5 treadmill. 

This state of existence is well-illustrated by popular media of the past generation such as the Matrix, Office Space and Fight Club. It is a modern problem, but not a new one. What could be its solution?

### Choices

I can take the blue pill, while trascending the mundane. My worldly observations will remain, but I can change my perception of reality. I can ascribe new meaning onto the status quo.

I can take the red pill, choosing to escape it. I can go Into The Wild or subscribe to [Anarcho-primitivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism) to join the Fight Club between Man and Society.

The alternative not shown in the movie is to gradually repair the relationship between Self and the world that surrounds it. The [stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) surrenders judgement outside of one's own [Circle of Influence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj8dmSgQa1c). [The Timeless Way of Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timeless_Way_of_Building) prescribes using "quality without a name" to identify what can be repaired. Seeing that the problem is [complex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puyeyYZXl0U), [Set-Based Design](http://scrumbook.org.datasenter.no/value-stream/set-based-design.html) highlights the order of repair operations. 

### Improvement

It may seem impossible to escape a cycle with no room to breathe. But what may first seem impossible without violent force can be done with the aid of mechanical advantage. In the case of [splitting rocks](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yOjcPY8NpX4), repeated momentum from a sledge hammer is combined with a series of wedges. It also helps to follow proven techniques employed by others. The same is in escaping the [rat race](https://youtu.be/e9dZQelULDk).
