If you were the first person to say "I am going to change the world", you may have gotten people's attention. But if you are the millionth person to say the same, you will certainly be ignored. 

You may have had the same genuine intention to make a difference as the first, but its meaning has been diluted in a sea of noise. The words you say now have a different meaning. Likewise, words like Lean, Scrum, and Agile; have all lost their meaning.

It doesn't matter what you meant by the words you said; it only matters what was understood.
