title: Inducing Reflexivity

[Reflexivity](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/ces/research/current/socialtheory/maps/reflexivity/) is the examination of one's own beliefs, judgments and practices. It's necessary for our learning and agency. For example, a [Sprint Retrospective](http://scrumbook.org.datasenter.no/value-stream/sprint/sprint-retrospective.html) in Scrum is a formal way to do it in a team context. 

In Academia, it's positively related to performance([source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00223980.2015.1050977)), so a manager may try to induce it out of their team by mandating it as an activity. But a forced retro is yet another useless meeting for an engineer.
