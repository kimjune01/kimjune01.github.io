A Heed to the Salaryman


i am a salary man
i eat salary

dude i want to experience motor cycle

Salary wages are more than enough for a motorcycle experience

yea but i have a car already.. and I am paying like 400 bucks every month
and I have to get like addtional... license

Easy
What do you want to do
While you're alive

that is the greatest question

Is motorcycle one of them

I want to rule the earth
and I am not joking

Then do it
Go rule the earth

but i am too insufficient
i don't have leadership
i am not smart

Get leadership
Get smart
You either do what you want or die trying
You take no compromises

i don't know where to start man

One step at a time
If you don't know where you are going but know it's somewhere over there, take that step to somewhere over there

i see

The worst thing that can happen is you tried, failed, and learned
I tell salary man what salary man needs to hear

You have amazing brains
Brains good for ruling earth

what do you mean you tell salary man what salary man needs to hear

It's easy to get stuck in a pattern of thought when each week is the same as others
Your thoughts become limited to the environment you've chosen to be in
New thoughts do not come by often in this environment
I throw you a new thought, whether right or wrong, smart or stupid, you decide.
But new ideas bring your mind to new places
And that's what I tried to do because you asked
I am not much other value to you, other than ideas
And it's all I have to give you other than a motorcycle ride

ah man

You're open minded and that alone will help you

man why are you so englightened
is this the effect of motorcycle

I am no more enlightened than you
I just see things different
It's because you chose to look outside where you are now
You choose to look outside more, and you will see more, like what I see

wow
too much inspiration
overloaded

Use it for good

what do u do these days then
how do you earn money

I read and write
I don't earn money
I don't need more money for now
I need to grow

then how do you pay for sutff??

Savings
I made money at my old job
Young Soo Harry Shin

you are a brave man june
compared to you i feel like i am a coward

Thank you
You are not a coward
You are a hero unawakened

i am always worried and anxious about things that might happen in the future
and I know I should let go, but  i can't

You know what's scarier than waking up on a couch when you're 40?
Waking up in a king sized bed with a wife you don't love sleeping on the other side with her back towards you
That's scary.

what the
oh i see
i get it

You know what's scarier than having to take the bus to work

what

Having to pay for a house mortgage to live close to the city for a work that you have to drive a car to which you have to pay monthly for to a job you don't like so that you can earn the money to pay for all the shit you have
That's scary. You can run away from a lease but not from a mortgage and monthly car payments
More isn't safe, less is safe.

wow
that's is some deep statement man
very difference perspective

It's only truth

different*
i never thought about it that way
hey we should meet up for a beer sometime

Sure thing
