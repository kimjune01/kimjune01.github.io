You have a conjecture. You try induction. It doesn't work. Now what?

Most people try induction again, harder. [Schoenfeld (1985)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/mathematical-problem-solving/71E357D32C51F5B4BB279C244ACA6E2F) filmed this: one technique, ridden to exhaustion, consuming the entire session. He called it the wild goose chase. Novices and experts know the same techniques. The difference is control — knowing when to switch and what to switch to.

He never specified *what*. This manual does. It doesn't prove your theory right. It makes it faster for it to be wrong.

## The procedure

1. Classify the claim (existence, bound, construction, ...) and the domain (discrete, algebraic, geometric, ...).
2. Look up candidates in the [grid](/data/proof-manual.yml). Scan the whole row, not just your first instinct.
3. Check kill conditions. Cross off the dead ones before you start.
4. Check symmetries. A technique that assumes the wrong symmetry fails silently.
5. Try the survivors. When one dies, the failure mode names the next.

## Kill conditions

The part nobody writes down.

| Technique | Kill condition | Escalate to |
|---|---|---|
| Induction | Residual loses structure | Potential method |
| Contradiction | ¬P doesn't interact with structure | Direct construction |
| Greedy | Local progress destroys substructure | Potential method |
| Pigeonhole | Same-size sets, need witness not existence | Probabilistic method |
| Probabilistic method | E[X]<1, or dependencies, or need witness | Second moment → LLL → derandomization |
| Spectral | Semiring without eigenvalues | Embed-solve-pullback |
| IVT / fixed point | Discrete or non-compact domain | Sperner, simplicial Brouwer |
| Invariant | No separating invariant visible | Reduction |
| Potential method | No monotone potential | Game equilibrium |
| Diagonalization | Uncountable candidates | Reduction |

The kill at step N names the technique at step N+1.

## Symmetry mismatch

If your problem lacks a symmetry your technique assumes, the technique produces a valid-looking argument with a hidden gap.

| You assume | It's actually | What dies |
|---|---|---|
| Undirected | Directed | Union-find, spanning trees |
| Transitive | Non-transitive | Reachability composition |
| Time-independent | Time-dependent | Static data structures |
| Commutative | Non-commutative | Abelian group tools |
| Local | Global | Heuristics, distributed algorithms |
| Linear | Nonlinear | Superposition, spectral decomposition |

## Embed-solve-pullback

When nothing in your domain works, change the domain.

| Source → Target | What you gain | What you risk |
|---|---|---|
| Combinatorics → 3-SAT | Exponential search | Clause structure artificial |
| Discrete → Geometry | Convexity, separation | Rounding loses feasibility |
| Nonlinear → Linear (LP/SDP) | Poly-time solvers | Integrality gap |
| Time domain → Frequency | Convolution → multiplication | Localization lost |
| Graph → Algebra (spectral) | Eigenvalue bounds | Semiring has no spectral theory |

The risk is always the same: the pullback doesn't preserve the constraints.

## The lineage

Every technique exists because its parent died on a specific problem:

```
Exhaustion (Archimedes)
  kill: can't handle infinite processes
  └→ Limits (Cauchy, Weierstrass)
     kill: need compactness for existence
     └→ Compactness arguments (Bolzano-Weierstrass)
        kill: need topology beyond R^n
        └→ General topology

Counting (Euler)
  kill: exact counts intractable
  └→ Generating functions
     kill: coefficients hard to extract
     └→ Analytic combinatorics (Flajolet)
        kill: need asymptotics not exact
        └→ Probabilistic method (Erdős, Alon & Spencer)

Diagonalization (Cantor)
  kill: need self-reference formalized
  └→ Incompleteness (Gödel)
     kill: need computation model
     └→ Undecidability (Turing)
        kill: need quantitative hardness
        └→ Complexity lower bounds (Cook, Karp)
```

A student who only knows induction will never try a potential method. One who knows potential methods exist *because* induction kills residual structure will reach for the right tool.

## Why it works

Every proof decomposes into compositions of six [type constructors](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/dependent_type_theory.html):

| Constructor | What it proves |
|---|---|
| Π (dependent function) | ∀, implication |
| Σ (dependent pair) | ∃, witness |
| Inductive type | Recursion, cases |
| Match | Case analysis, induction |
| Quotient | Equivalence |
| Truncation | Non-constructive existence |

The grid's rows map to these: existence = Σ, impossibility = Π→False, construction = Σ with computability. Kill conditions are type errors — your proof term doesn't inhabit the target type. Lean's type checker rejects proofs for the same reasons the kill conditions predict.

Pick your stuck conjecture. Run the procedure. If the manual doesn't surface a technique you haven't tried, it's incomplete — [tell me what's missing](https://github.com/kimjune01/june.kim/blob/master/src/data/proof-manual.yml).
