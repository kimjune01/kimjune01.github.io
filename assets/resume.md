## Summary

Applied AI Engineer specializing in RAG pipelines, agentic workflows, and LLM-powered data systems. 10+ years of software engineering at Google, Loom, and high-growth startups. Builds production AI systems that ship.

## Work Experience

### Independent Contractor — Applied AI Engineer
**2025 — present**

- **Anyteam.com:** Designed and shipped an accessibility data pipeline for the Sales OS and a browser-extension-based web scraper to ingest and retrieve domain knowledge via Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- **Buildbetter.ai:** Built 4 third-party integrations (Circle.so, Notion, Front, Attio) with incremental sync, OAuth2 flows, and deduplication, expanding the platform's customer data ingestion surface.
- Developed AI-powered field classification system using LLMs to automatically map import columns with confidence scoring, and prototyped custom AI agents for customer signal analysis.
- Shipped CI/CD quality gates, E2E testing infrastructure, and reusable developer tooling (Claude Code skills for log querying, migration gen, CI failure analysis).

### Littlebird — Applied AI Engineer
**Sep 2024 — May 2025**

- Designed and implemented agentic data ingestion pipelines, utilizing LLM-based condensation (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini Flash) and deduplication to reduce noise by 90%, directly improving RAG retrieval accuracy and chat grounding.
- Architected macOS and Chrome integrations (Swift, Tauri, Rust) using Accessibility APIs to enable real-time context injection for AI agents.
- Developed core Python backend services for prompt orchestration and object deduplication, leading infrastructure migrations with zero user downtime.
- Built end-to-end RAG pipeline: filtered, extracted, parsed, and condensed unstructured desktop accessibility data into a searchable vector store.

### Loom — Senior Software Engineer
**Mar 2022 — May 2023**

- Optimized core video infrastructure, increasing system reliability from 97% to 99.7% via multiresolution UI implementations and Shaka Player interfacing.
